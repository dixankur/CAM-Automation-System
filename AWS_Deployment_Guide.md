   - **Default output format**: `json`

## üì• Step 2: Download the Project Code

### 2.1 Clone the Repository
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., Desktop):
   ```
   cd Desktop
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dixankur/CAM-Automation-System.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```
   cd CAM-Automation-System
   ```

## üîß Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

### 3.1 Install Main Dependencies
1. In the project root folder, run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   **Wait for this to complete** - it may take several minutes

### 3.2 Install Service Dependencies
1. Navigate to the services folder:
   ```
   cd services
   ```
2. Install service dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Go back to the project root:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```

### 3.3 Install Infrastructure Dependencies
1. Navigate to the infrastructure folder:
   ```
   cd infrastructure
   ```
2. Install infrastructure dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Go back to the project root:
   ```
   cd ..
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Bootstrap AWS CDK (One-time setup)

### 4.1 Bootstrap CDK in Your AWS Account
1. From the project root, run:
   ```
   cdk bootstrap
   ```
2. **Wait for completion** - this sets up necessary AWS resources for CDK
3. You should see a success message when done

## üöÄ Step 5: Deploy Infrastructure to AWS

### 5.1 Build the Infrastructure
1. From the project root, run:
   ```
   npm run build:infrastructure
   ```
2. Wait for the build to complete

### 5.2 Deploy Infrastructure
1. Run the deployment command:
   ```
   npm run deploy:infrastructure
   ```
2. **Important**: You may be prompted to approve security changes - type `y` and press Enter
3. **This will take 10-20 minutes** - AWS is creating all the necessary resources
4. **Do not close the terminal** during this process

### 5.3 Verify Infrastructure Deployment
1. Log into your AWS Console
2. Check the following services to confirm resources were created:
   - **CloudFormation**: You should see stacks created
   - **Lambda**: You should see functions created
   - **DynamoDB**: You should see tables created
   - **S3**: You should see buckets created

## üì± Step 6: Deploy Application Services

### 6.1 Build Services
1. From the project root, run:
   ```
   npm run build:services
   ```

### 6.2 Deploy Services
1. Run the deployment command:
   ```
   npm run deploy:services
   ```
2. Wait for completion (5-10 minutes)

## üåê Step 7: Access Your Application

### 7.1 Find Your Application URL
1. In AWS Console, go to **API Gateway**
2. Find your CAM Automation API
3. Click on it and look for the "Invoke URL"
4. Copy this URL - this is your application's web address

### 7.2 Test Your Application
1. Open a web browser
2. Go to your application URL
3. You should see the CAM Automation System interface

## üîç Step 8: Monitor and Manage Your Application

### 8.1 Check Application Logs
1. In AWS Console, go to **CloudWatch**
2. Click "Log groups"
3. Look for log groups related to your application
4. Click on them to view application logs

### 8.2 Monitor Costs
1. In AWS Console, go to **Billing & Cost Management**
2. Check your current usage and costs
3. Set up billing alerts if desired

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 9: Making Updates to Your Application

### 9.1 When You Make Code Changes
1. Navigate to your project folder on your computer
2. Make your code changes
3. Commit changes to Git:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your change description"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Redeploy:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Access Denied" Errors
- **Solution**: Check your AWS credentials are correctly configured
- Run `aws configure list` to verify

### Issue 2: CDK Bootstrap Fails
- **Solution**: Ensure you have proper AWS permissions
- Your AWS user needs Administrator access or specific CDK permissions

### Issue 3: Deployment Takes Too Long
- **Solution**: This is normal for first deployment
- Infrastructure creation can take 15-30 minutes

### Issue 4: Application Not Loading
- **Solution**: Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- Verify all services deployed successfully

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Expected AWS Costs
- **Development/Testing**: $10-50/month
- **Production**: $100-500/month (depending on usage)
- **Free Tier**: Some services may be free for first 12 months

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use AWS Free Tier when possible
2. Set up billing alerts
3. Stop/delete resources when not needed
4. Monitor usage regularly

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never share your AWS access keys**
2. **Use strong passwords for AWS account**
3. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on your AWS account**
4. **Regularly rotate access keys**
5. **Monitor AWS CloudTrail for unusual activity**

## üìû Getting Help

### If You Get Stuck:
1. **Check AWS Documentation**: [docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com)
2. **AWS Support**: Available through AWS Console
3. **Community Forums**: AWS Developer Forums
4. **Stack Overflow**: Search for specific error messages
